It is used by Shared Mobility operators to allocate assets for car share, ride share, car club, peer to peer vehicle sharing and pooling. It is also used to plan entry into new markets based on density and as a raw data asset to build into existing routing algorithms to make transportation more efficient. The dataset for the Hackathon includes the Chicagoland region.",
